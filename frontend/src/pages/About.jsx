          Raidenn is a project which was created as a portfolio piece. It was
          also to be a challenge as new packages were used in Raidenn the
          creator had never used before. It will be going through many version
          updates, which will include improvements to the UX as well as new
          backend functionality. The premise of this project for the creator was
          also o practise his design skills and animation skills. All clip
          animations(WebM Format) on the site were hand crafted for this
          project. Any and all feedback is welcome on this project, drop me an
          email and I will be sure to check it out.
